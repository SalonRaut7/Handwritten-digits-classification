# Handwritten Digit Classification

This project is a machine learning application for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and testing with custom images.

## Project Structure

- `handwritten.py`: Main script containing the implementation of data preprocessing, neural network model creation, training, evaluation, and testing.
- `handwritten.keras`: Saved model file after training.
- `digits/`: Directory containing PNG images of handwritten digits for testing.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
